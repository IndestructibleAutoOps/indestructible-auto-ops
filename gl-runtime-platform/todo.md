# GL Runtime Platform - High Priority Tasks

## Phase 1: Complete V20 Build
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Update package.json to v20.0.0
- [x] Update tsconfig.json to include infinite-continuum
- [x] Successfully build gl-runtime-platform

## Phase 2: GL Code Intelligence & Security Layer（生成型）
- [x] Create code-intel-security-layer/ directory structure
- [x] Implement capability-schema/ (Capability Description Language)
- [x] Implement pattern-library/ (Security/Performance/Architecture Patterns)
- [x] Implement generator-engine/ (Capability Generation Engine)
- [x] Implement evaluation-engine/ (Verification Layer)
- [x] Implement deployment-weaver/ (CLI/IDE/Web/CI/CD Integration)
- [x] Implement evolution-engine/ (Self-Evolving System)
- [x] Integrate with Unified Intelligence Fabric (V19)
- [x] Integrate with Infinite Learning Continuum (V20)
- [x] Test complete capability generation workflow

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Parallel Orchestration

- [ ] Implement reporting aggregator agent
- [ ] Set up communication channels (event-bus, notifications)
- [ ] Configure resource limits and monitoring
- [ ] Test parallel execution with all agents

## Phase 4: Global Governance Audit
- [x] Scan gl-runtime-platform/ all files

- [x] Scan instant/ subsystems
- [x] Scan summarized_conversations/ data layer
- [x] Generate per-file JSON audit reports
- [x] Generate global governance audit report
- [x] Generate complete governance event stream

## Phase 5: Test Code Intelligence & Security Layer
- [x] Test Capability Schema generation
- [x] Test Pattern Library matching
- [x] Test Generator Engine
- [x] Test Evaluation Engine verification
- [x] Test Deployment Weaver
- [x] Test Evolution Engine
- [x] Test V19 Fabric integration
- [x] Test V20 Continuum integration
- [x] Generate test report with metrics

## Phase 6: Final Integration & Deployment
- [ ] Ensure all modules build successfully
- [ ] Ensure all modules integrate GL governance layer
- [ ] Ensure all modules are executable, deployable, repairable, auditable
- [ ] Ensure all pipelines run successfully
- [ ] Ensure all connectors run successfully
- [ ] Ensure all APIs run successfully
- [ ] Ensure all event streams and artifacts run successfully
- [ ] Deploy and validate complete platform

## Phase 7: Micro-adjustments Based on Recommendations（微調階段）
### Priority 1: Immediate Execution（立即執行）
- [x] Verify all modules build successfully (30 min)
- [x] Execute comprehensive security scan (1 hour)
- [x] Verify all pipelines and connectors (1 hour)

### Priority 2: Short-term Execution（短期執行）
- [ ] Execute integration tests (2 hours)
- [ ] Batch add governance tags to existing files (1 hour)
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to key modules (2 hours)

### Priority 3: Medium-term Execution（中期執行）
- [ ] Execute performance testing (2 hours)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting (2 hours)
- [ ] Complete API and deployment documentation (1 hour)

### Priority 4: Long-term Optimization（長期優化）
- [ ] Expand Pattern Library with more patterns
- [ ] Optimize Evolution Engine
- [ ] Improve documentation coverage
