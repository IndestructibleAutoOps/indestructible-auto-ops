# GL Runtime Platform Version 17.0.0 - Trans-Domain Integration Architecture

## 🌌 Version Overview

**GL Runtime Platform Version 17.0.0: Trans-Domain Integration Architecture (跨域整合架構)**

This version represents the **"External Expansion of Intelligence" (智慧的外延擴張階段)**. Unlike Version 16 which focused on internal context integration, Version 17 enables the system to integrate with external systems, knowledge bases, models, and civilizations across domains.

### Key Philosophy

> **Version 17 is not about "transcending humanity" or "consciousness"**
> 
> It is about creating a platform that can:
> - Integrate external platforms and systems
> - Exchange semantics with external models
> - Share reasoning with external tools
> - Align with external knowledge bases
> - Maintain consistency, stability, and explainability across all domains

### Core Positioning

**Version 16 (Omni-Context Integration):**
> Integrates all internal contexts, maintains intelligent consistency

**Version 17 (Trans-Domain Integration):**
> Integrates all external systems, knowledge, models, civilizations
