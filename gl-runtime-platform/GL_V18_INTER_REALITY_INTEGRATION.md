# GL Runtime Platform Version 18.0.0 - Inter-Reality Integration Architecture

## 🌌 Version Overview

**GL Runtime Platform Version 18.0.0: Inter-Reality Integration Architecture (多現實整合架構)**

This version represents the **"Cross-Framework Stability Stage of Intelligence" (智慧的跨框架穩定性階段)**. It enables the GL Runtime to maintain consistent, stable, and explainable intelligent behavior across "multiple environments, frameworks, rules, perspectives, and levels".

### Key Philosophy

> **Version 18 is NOT about "transcending humanity" or "consciousness"**
> 
> It is about creating a platform that can:
> - Maintain intelligent consistency across different reality frameworks
> - Adapt reasoning, strategy, mesh structure, and swarm allocation to different environments
> - Extract invariant knowledge that is independent of environment, language, culture, and system
> - Govern across different frameworks, worlds, civilizations, and meshes

### Core Positioning

**Version 17 (Trans-Domain Integration):**
> Integrates external systems, knowledge, models, civilizations

**Version 18 (Inter-Reality Integration):**
> Maintains stability and consistency across different "reality frameworks"

### What is "Reality"?

In this context, "reality" refers to:
- Different rule environments
- Different logic systems
- Different semantic worlds
- Different data models
- Different governance frameworks
- Different reasoning approaches
- Different cultural backgrounds
- Different technology stacks
- Different organizational structures

The goal is to create a system that maintains intelligent consistency across ANY framework.

## 🧠 Six Core Capabilities

### 1. Reality-Model Abstraction (現實模型抽象)
**"Unified Semantics, Rules, Structures, and Reasoning Frameworks"**

The system can:
- Abstract different environments into unified semantics

This allows the system to switch freely between different "worlds".

**Components:**
- Reality model registration and management
- Semantic abstraction to unified semantics
- Rule abstraction to unified rules
- Structure abstraction to unified structures
- Reasoning framework abstraction to unified reasoning
- Reality switching capabilities

### 2. Multi-Reality Mapping (多現實映射)
**"Cross-Framework Intelligence"**

The system can:
- Map rules from World A to World B
- Map semantics from System A to System B
- Map structures from Civilization A to Civilization B

**Components:**
- Reality mapping between worlds, systems, civilizations
