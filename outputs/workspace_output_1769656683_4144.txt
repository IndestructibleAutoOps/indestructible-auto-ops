# GL Runtime Platform - High Priority Tasks

## Phase 1: Complete V20 Build
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Update package.json to v20.0.0
- [x] Update tsconfig.json to include infinite-continuum
- [x] Successfully build gl-runtime-platform

## Phase 2: GL Code Intelligence & Security Layer（生成型）
- [x] Create code-intel-security-layer/ directory structure
- [x] Implement capability-schema/ (Capability Description Language)
- [x] Implement pattern-library/ (Security/Performance/Architecture Patterns)
- [x] Implement generator-engine/ (Capability Generation Engine)
- [x] Implement evaluation-engine/ (Verification Layer)
- [ ] Implement deployment-weaver/ (CLI/IDE/Web/CI/CD Integration)
- [ ] Implement evolution-engine/ (Self-Evolving System)
- [ ] Integrate with Unified Intelligence Fabric (V19)
- [ ] Integrate with Infinite Learning Continuum (V20)
- [ ] Test complete capability generation workflow

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Parallel Orchestration
