# =============================================================================
# CORE PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
philosophy:
  objective: "Eliminate subjective language from all governance records"
  principle: "Compliance decisions based solely on objective facts"
  goal: "Infinitely defensible compliance in audit and regulatory contexts"
  
  narrative_elimination:
    prohibition:
      - "No subjective adjectives (good, bad, excellent, poor)"
      - "No opinion-based qualifiers (seems, appears, likely)"
      - No unquantified measurements (fast, slow, many, few)
      - "No vague temporal references (recently, soon, eventually)"
      - "No categorical statements without evidence (always, never)"
      - "No comparative claims without metrics (better, worse)"
      - "No causal claims without proof (because, therefore)"
      
    requirement:
      - "All claims MUST be quantifiable"
      - "All statements MUST have supporting evidence"
      - "All measurements MUST have units"
      - "All temporal references MUST be precise"
      - "All categorical statements MUST be testable"
      - "All comparisons MUST use metrics"
      - "All causal claims MUST have proof"

# =============================================================================

      required: "The system processes 10,000 requests/second with 99.9th percentile latency of 50ms"
      
      prohibited: "Many violations were detected"
      required: "15,234 violations were detected in the last 24 hours"
      
      prohibited: "Performance improved significantly"
      required: "Throughput increased by 47% from 1,234 to 1,814 requests/second"

  evidence_requirement:
    mandatory:
      - "Every claim MUST reference specific evidence"

      - "Evidence MUST be accessible and verifiable"
      - "Evidence MUST have SHA3-512 hash"
      - "Evidence MUST be timestamped"

      required: "Zero critical vulnerabilities detected in latest scan (evidence: security_scan_report_20260205.json, hash: sha3-512:...)"

  precision:
    mandatory:
      - "Use exact values, not ranges"
      - "Specify precision (significant figures)"
      - "Include uncertainty estimates"
      - "Use ISO 8601 for timestamps"
      - "Use timezone information"
      
    examples:
      prohibited: "The error occurred around 10am"
      required: "The error occurred at 2026-02-05T10:23:45.678Z (UTC)"
      
      prohibited: "Latency is about 50ms"
      required: "Latency is 52.3ms ± 2.1ms (95% confidence interval)"

      prohibited: "The code is clean"
      required: "Code complexity score: 3.2/10 (maintainability index), zero critical code smells detected (evidence: code_quality_report.json, hash: sha3-512:...)"
