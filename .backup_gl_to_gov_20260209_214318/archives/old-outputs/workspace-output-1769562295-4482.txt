# Data Synchronization Service

## Overview

This directory contains the Data Synchronization Service for the MachineNativeOps platform. The service provides comprehensive data synchronization capabilities between two systems with advanced features including conflict resolution, incremental sync, retry logic, data validation, and monitoring.

## GL Unified Charter Activated

This service is governed by the GL (Governance Layers) Unified Charter and follows all governance requirements:

- **Governance Layer**: GL90-99
- **Charter Version**: 2.0.0
- **Semantic Anchor**: ../../engine/governance/GL_SEMANTIC_ANCHOR.json

## Integration with Agent Orchestration

This service integrates with the `.github/agents/agent-orchestration.yml` system as a high-priority synchronization agent:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: data-sync-agent
    name: "Data Synchronization Agent"
    type: "synchronization"
    priority: 1
    enabled: true
    config:
      serviceConfig: "instant/configs/data-sync-config.yaml"
      pipelines:
        - "users-sync"
        - "orders-sync"
        - "inventory-sync"
    outputs:
      - "sync-status.json"
      - "sync-report.md"
```

## Integration with File Organizer System

The service works with the `file-organizer-system` for:
- Configuration file management
- Artifact storage and organization
- Log file management
- Backup and archive operations

## Integration with AEP Engine

The service leverages the `engine` (Architecture Execution Pipeline) for:
- Architecture validation and compliance
- Governance enforcement
- Semantic anchoring and evidence chain generation
