2. **Configure Environment**: Update `.env` with your settings
3. **Run Verification**: Execute `make verify` to ensure everything works
4. **Test the System**: Run `make test-reasoning` to test the pipeline
5. **Monitor Metrics**: Set up Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
6. **Integrate with IDE**: Develop plugins for VSCode/JetBrains
7. **Add More Rules**: Extend arbitration rules for your use cases
8. **Train the System**: Collect feedback and optimize thresholds

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Internal and external retrieval are completely isolated
2. **Rule-Based Arbitration**: Rules take precedence over confidence-based decisions
3. **Complete Audit Trail**: All actions are logged with full context
4. **Feedback-Driven**: System improves through user feedback
5. **Policy as Code**: All policies defined in code, not configuration
6. **Security First**: Pinned SHAs, minimal permissions, SBOM, signing
7. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
8. **Automated Fixing**: Auto-fix capabilities with PR creation
