        - "No explicit admission/authorization gate definition"
        - "No drift reconciliation contract"
    - id: RCA-02

        - "No artifact class coverage (models, dashboards, base images)"
    - id: RCA-03
      statement: "Resilience validated procedurally (playbooks) but not systematically (chaos + SLO-driven automation)."
      evidence:
        - "No chaos test suite required"
        - "No error-budget based rollout/rollback policy"
    - id: RCA-04
      statement: "Open-system boundaries not proven; network/service identity contracts are not tested as first-class."
