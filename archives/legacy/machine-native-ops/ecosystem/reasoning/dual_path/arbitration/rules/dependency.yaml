    priority: HIGH
    decision: INTERNAL
    confidence_threshold: 0.8
    description: |
      For internal dependencies, always prefer internal sources to ensure

    conditions:
      - field: dependency_type
        operator: equals

  - rule_id: "DEP002"
    name: "THIRD_PARTY_DEPENDENCY"
    priority: MEDIUM
    decision: HYBRID
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    description: |
      For third-party dependencies, use hybrid approach to balance
      internal compatibility with external best practices.
    
    conditions:
      - field: dependency_type
        operator: equals
        value: third_party
        
    reasoning: |
      Third-party dependencies need internal compatibility checks and
      external documentation. Hybrid approach provides comprehensive view.
