# Deprecated temporary script for fixing src/adapters/github/tools.ts.
# 
# This script previously applied one-off sed and Python-based edits to
# src/adapters/github/tools.ts. Those fixes must now live directly in the
# TypeScript source, and this script should no longer be used.
# 
# It is intentionally a no-op stub to prevent accidental modification of
# the source tree. If you believe you still need this behavior, update
# src/adapters/github/tools.ts directly instead of reviving this script.
