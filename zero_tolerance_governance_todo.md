# Zero-Tolerance GL-Registry Governance Engineering - Project Plan

## Overview
Create comprehensive zero-tolerance strict engineering specifications and execution protocols for the GL-Registry governance framework, integrating global best practices adapted to the IndestructibleAutoOps platform.

## Phase 1: Deep Retrieval & Best Practices Analysis

- [x] Analyze NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001 governance requirements
- [x] Study Service Registry patterns (Netflix Eureka, Kubernetes Service Discovery, Consul)
- [x] Review Configuration as Code (CaC) and Governance as Code (GaC) implementations
- [x] Examine evidence-native architecture frameworks from industry leaders
- [x] Analyze cryptographic hash chain best practices (SHA3-512, BLAKE3)
- [x] Research semantic analysis and narrative-free enforcement systems
- [x] Study autonomous governance and AI-powered remediation systems
- [x] Review zero-trust security implementation patterns
- [x] Analyze audit trail and reproducible verification systems
- [x] Research post-quantum cryptography standards (NIST PQC 2024)
- [x] Analyze hardware security module (HSM) best practices
- [x] Study software supply chain security (SLSA, in-toto, SBOM)
- [x] Review latest compliance frameworks (NIST CSF 2.0, EO 14028)

## Phase 2: Zero-Tolerance Strict Definition Engineering

- [x] Establish zero-tolerance violation classification system
- [x] Define automated validation requirements for all artifacts
- [x] Create semantic distillation protocols
- [x] Establish reproducible verification standards
- [x] Define language-neutral governance enforcement rules
- [x] Define post-quantum cryptography integration (NIST PQC 2024)
- [x] Create hardware security module (HSM) integration specifications
- [x] Define software supply chain security (SLSA Level 4) requirements
- [x] Create enhanced evidence chain with SLSA provenance

## Phase 3: Zero-Tolerance Strict Execution Engineering

- [x] Create automated enforcement pipeline specifications
- [x] Define CI/CD integration with zero-tolerance gates
- [x] Establish automated fix generation with safety measures
- [x] Create rollback and recovery protocols
- [x] Define real-time violation detection and blocking
- [x] Establish evidence generation and verification automation
- [x] Create audit trail generation and preservation
- [x] Define governance event stream processing
- [x] Establish automated compliance reporting
- [x] Create cross-registry consistency validation

## Phase 4: Implementation & Integration
