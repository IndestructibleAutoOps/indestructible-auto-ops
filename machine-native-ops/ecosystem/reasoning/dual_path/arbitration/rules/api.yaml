rules:
  - rule_id: "API001"
    name: "CODE_STYLE_PREFERENCE"
    priority: MEDIUM
    decision: INTERNAL
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    description: |
      For code style preferences, prefer internal sources to maintain
      consistency with project coding standards.
    
    conditions:
      - field: task_type
        operator: equals
        value: style_check
        
      - field: internal_confidence
        operator: greater_than
        value: 0.7
        
    reasoning: |
      Internal style guides ensure consistency across the codebase.
      External sources may suggest different styles that conflict with
      project standards.

  - rule_id: "API002"
    name: "GL_PLATFORM_API"
    priority: HIGH
    decision: INTERNAL
    confidence_threshold: 0.8
    description: |
      For GL platform APIs, always prefer internal sources as they are
      the authoritative source of truth.
    
    conditions:
      - field: module
        operator: starts_with
        value: gl-
        
      - field: task_type
        operator: equals
        value: api_usage
        
    reasoning: |
      GL platform APIs are defined internally. External documentation may
      be outdated or incomplete. Internal sources are authoritative.

  - rule_id: "API003"
    name: "EXTERNAL_LIBRARY_USAGE"
    priority: LOW
    decision: EXTERNAL
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    description: |
      For external library usage, prefer external documentation sources
      as they provide official API references.
    
    conditions:
      - field: library_type
        operator: equals
        value: external
        
      - field: task_type
        operator: equals
        value: api_usage
        
    reasoning: |
      External libraries have official documentation that is more
      reliable than internal examples or StackOverflow answers.
