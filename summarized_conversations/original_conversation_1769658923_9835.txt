Here's a summary:\n\n### ✅ Phase 2: GL Code Intelligence & Security Layer (生成型) - COMPLETE\n\n**Components Implemented:**\n1. **Capability Schema** - Complete capability description language with type definitions\n2. **Pattern Library** - Security, performance, and architecture patterns\n3. **Generator Engine** - Capability generation engine with pattern matching\n4. **Evaluation Engine** - Comprehensive verification layer with multiple evaluation criteria\n5. **Deployment Weaver** - CLI/IDE/Web/CI/CD integration with deployment to multiple platforms\n6. **Evolution Engine** - Self-evolving system with usage-based optimization\n7. **Fabric & Continuum Integration** - Seamless integration with V19 Unified Intelligence Fabric and V20 Infinite Learning Continuum\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Auto-generation of CLI tools, VSCode extensions, web consoles, CI/CD workflows\n- Self-evolving capabilities based on usage data\n- Cross-version integration between V19 and V20\n- Comprehensive evaluation with behavior equivalence, security regression, semantic consistency\n- Multi-platform deployment (CLI, VSCode, Web, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes)\n\n### ✅ Phase 3: Multi-Agent Parallel Orchestration - ALREADY COMPLETE\n\n**12 Specialized Agents Configured:**\n1. GL Governance Validator Agent\n2. Semantic Analyzer Agent\n3. Semantic Validator Agent\n4. Semantic Repair Agent\n5. CodeQL Monitor Agent\n6. Quality Assurance Agent\n7. Dependency Scanner Agent\n8. Architecture Validator Agent\n9. Documentation Generator Agent\n10. Performance Monitor Agent\n11. Data Sync Agent\n12. Security Auditor Agent\n13. Reporting Aggregator Agent\n\n**Orchestration Features:**\n- Parallel execution with max 8 concurrent agents\n- Semantic Resource Graph (SRG) awareness\n- GL governance integration\n- Event bus and notification channels\n- Resource limits and monitoring\n- Dependency management between agents\n\n### Build Status\n✅ **V20 Build Complete** - All TypeScript code compiles successfully with no errors\n\n### Next Steps\nThe next phase would be **Phase 4: Global Governance Audit**, which involves scanning all files across the workspace and generating comprehensive audit reports.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with Phase 4, or would you prefer to focus on a different area?\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\nI've successfully completed Phase 2 (GL Code Intelligence & Security Layer) with full implementation of all components including Fabric & Continuum integration. Phase 3 (Multi-Agent Parallel Orchestration) was already complete with all 12 agents properly configured.\n\n**Completed Work:**\n- ✅ Capability Schema, Pattern Library, Generator Engine\n- ✅ Evaluation Engine, Deployment Weaver, Evolution Engine  \n- ✅ Fabric & Continuum Integration (V19 + V20)\n- ✅ Build successful with no errors\n- ✅ All 12 agents configured in agent-orchestration.yml\n\n**Next Phase Options:**\n1. **Phase 4: Global Governance Audit** - Scan all files and generate comprehensive audit reports\n2. **Phase 5: Final Integration & Deployment** - Deploy and validate the complete platform\n3. Test the Code Intelligence & Security Layer with actual code analysis\n4. Implement additional features or enhancements\n\nWhich would you like me to focus on next?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>"}

It provides a standardized way to describe what a capability does, its inputs/outputs, dimensions, guarantees, and metadata.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Capability\n\nA **Capability** is the fundamental unit of the CDL. It represents a specific function that the Code Intelligence & Security Layer can perform.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)\n- `name`: Human-readable name\n- `version`: Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0")\n- `category`: Capability category (8 predefined categories)\n- `description`: Detailed description of what the capability does\n\n### Capability Categories\n\n1. **deep-code-understanding**: Semantic analysis and code comprehension\n2. **security-hardening**: Security vulnerability detection and fixing\n3. **performance-optimization**: Code performance improvements\n4. **architecture-refactoring**: Structural code improvements\n5. **test-generation**: Automated test case creation\n6. **documentation-synthesis**: Documentation generation\n7. **dependency-analysis**: Dependency management and analysis\n8. **vulnerability-detection**: Security vulnerability scanning\n\n### Input Types\n\n- `sourcecode`: Source code files\n- `runtimetraces`: Execution traces\n- `dependency-graph`: Dependency relationships\n- `configuration`: Configuration files\n- `metrics`: Performance metrics\n- `logs`: Application logs\n- `user-feedback`: User feedback and annotations\n- `pattern-hints`: Pattern matching hints\n\n### Output Types\n\n- `semantic-model`: Semantic representation of code\n- `architecture-map`: Architecture visualization\n- `risk-profile`: Security and risk assessment\n- `patch`: Code patch\n- `refactored-code`: Refactored source code\n- `test-cases`: Test suite\n- `documentation`: Generated documentation\n- `metrics`: Performance metrics\n- `report`: Analysis report\n- `visualization`: Visual representation\n\n## Example Capability Definition\n\n```typescript\n{\n  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",\n  "name": "SQL Injection Detector",\n  "version": "1.0.0",\n  "category": "security-hardening",\n  "description": "Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities in code",\n  "inputs": [\n    {\n      "id": "source-code",\n      "type": "sourcecode",\n      "description": "Source code to analyze",\n      "required": true\n    }\n  ],\n  "outputs": [\n    {\n      "id": "vulnerabilities",\n      "type": "risk-profile",\n      "description": "Detected SQL injection vulnerabilities",\n      "format": "sarif"\n    }\n  ],\n  "dimensions": {\n    "precision": 0.95,\n    "recall": 0.90,\n    "f1-score": 0.92,\n    "latency-ms": 500,\n    "throughput-files-per-second": 10\n  },\n  "guarantees": [\n    {\n      "type": "no-false-positives",\n      "description": "Zero false positive rate on known safe code"\n    }\n  ],\n  "metadata": {\n    "author": "GL Security Team",\n    "created-at": "2026-01-29T00:00:00Z",\n    "updated-at": "2026-01-29T00:00:00Z"\n  },\n  "evolution": {\n    "generation": 1,\n    "usage-count": 0,\n    "success-rate": 1.0,\n    "average-performance": 0.0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Validation Rules\n\nCapabilities support validation rules for inputs:\n\n- **regex**: Pattern matching with regular expressions\n- **schema**: JSON schema validation\n- **custom**: Custom validation functions\n- **type-check**: Type checking\n\n## Dimensions\n\nCapabilities are measured along multiple dimensions:\n\n- **precision**: Accuracy of positive predictions\n- **recall**: Coverage of actual positives\n- **f1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall\n- **latency-ms**: Execution time\n- **throughput-files-per-second**: Processing speed\n\n## Evolution Tracking\n\nEvery capability tracks its evolution:\n\n- **generation**: Evolution generation number\n- **usage-count**: Number of times used\n- **success-rate**: Percentage of successful executions\n- **average-performance**: Average performance score\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Use descriptive names and detailed descriptions\n2. Define clear input/output contracts\n3. Set realistic dimension targets\n4. Track evolution for continuous improvement\n5. Use UUIDs for capability IDs\n\n## Version Compatibility\n\n- CDL Version: 21.0.0\n- Backward Compatible With: 20.x.x\n- Breaking Changes: None\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}
