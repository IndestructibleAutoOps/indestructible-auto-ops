# GL10-29 Operational Layer - Comprehensive Recalibration Plan

## Overview
Performing detailed recalibration of GL10-29 Operational Layer based on main branch structure, ensuring every detail is properly implemented according to the provided specification.

## Recalibration Methodology

### Phase 1: Structural Verification (Current)
- Verify directory structure matches specification
- Check all expected artifacts exist
- Validate artifact naming conventions
- Confirm GL DSL compliance

### Phase 2: Semantic Boundary Verification
- Verify language definitions match specification
- Check functional boundaries are correctly defined
- Validate semantic consistency across artifacts
- Ensure no boundary violations

### Phase 3: Skills & Capabilities Verification
- Verify all required skills are documented
- Check capability mappings are complete
- Validate skill gaps are addressed
- Ensure training materials align with requirements

### Phase 4: Responsibilities & Tasks Verification
- Verify all responsibilities are defined
- Check task assignments are complete
- Validate task dependencies are correct
- Ensure accountability is clear

### Phase 5: Artifacts Verification
- Verify all expected artifacts exist
- Check artifact content completeness
- Validate artifact interdependencies
- Ensure version control is implemented

### Phase 6: Layer Dependencies Verification
- Verify upstream dependencies (GL00-09)
- Check downstream dependencies (GL30-49)
- Validate interaction mechanisms
- Ensure data flow is correct

### Phase 7: High-Weight Prompts Verification
- Verify all execution prompts are defined
- Check prompt functionality is tested
- Validate prompt outputs are actionable
- Ensure prompt automation is implemented

## Expected GL10-29 Structure (Based on Specification)

### Required Directories:
```
