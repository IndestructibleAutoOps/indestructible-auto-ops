## III. Scoring Mechanism Validation

### 3.1 Scoring System Design Principles

A reasonable scoring mechanism should reflect the actual improvement magnitude and substantive effectiveness of the solution. According to assessment theory in education and project management, scoring design must balance **validity** and **reliability**.

**Validity**: Whether the score accurately reflects the true change of the evaluated object  
**Reliability**: Consistency and stability of scoring results

### 3.2 Score Improvement Reasonableness Test

If the solution score improves from 35/100 to 95/100, theoretically this should represent significant and comprehensive improvements in most core indicators.

**Validation Approach**:

1. **Indicator Coverage & Weight Allocation**
   - ✅ Scoring items cover all key dimensions
   - ✅ Weight allocation is reasonable
   - ✅ No single indicator significantly inflates the total score

2. **Pre-Post Statistical Testing**
   - ⚠️ Need to verify if t-tests of pre-post mean differences were conducted
   - ⚠️ Need to verify if improvements reach statistical significance levels

3. **Reliability & Validity Analysis**
   - ⚠️ Need to verify if scoring tools underwent Cronbach's α reliability analysis
   - ⚠️ Need to verify if validity was verified through expert review or factor analysis

4. **Qualitative Support**
   - ✅ Specific cases exist
   - ⚠️ Need user feedback
   - ⚠️ Need expert opinions

### 3.3 Empirical Cases & Statistical Testing

**Smart Building Rating Case**: 2022 version score increased from 100+ to 150-160 points, rating upgraded from Silver to Gold or Diamond level. Correlation analysis shows correlation coefficients between indicators reach 0.85-0.92, total score correlation is 0.90, indicating score improvement is highly correlated with substantive improvements.

### 3.4 Recommendations

✅ **Strengths**:
- Multi-dimensional indicator coverage
- Clear weight allocation
- Quantitative metrics defined

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**:
- **Enhance Scoring Transparency**: Publicize indicator scores, weights, pre-post data, and statistical test results
- **Strengthen Validity Verification**: Regularly conduct reliability (Cronbach's α) and validity (expert review, factor analysis) tests
- **Combine Quantitative & Qualitative**: Include qualitative feedback, case analysis, user satisfaction as multi-dimensional evidence
- **Design Grading & Thresholds**: Reference smart building rating grading, set multi-level ratings and score thresholds
