  description: >
    Defines the unified governance specification for all governance modules.
    Establishes mandatory requirements for registration, semantic attachment,
    integrity boundaries, evidence generation, and verification.

  root_anchor: "gov-root"

  mandatory_requirements:
    - each governance module must provide governance-binding.yaml
    - each module must attach to the semantic-tree
    - each module must define a hash boundary specification
    - each module must expose evidence paths
    - each module must support deterministic replay
    - each module must pass global verification rules
    - all pipelines must be stoppable, replayable, and integrity-protected

  governance_dimensions:
    - semantic_consistency
    - execution_consistency
    - evidence_integrity
    - replay_determinism
    - boundary_compliance
